# solving_polynomials
Using python scipy to solve polynomials by finding their possible zeroes and real zeroes
This code uses Python libraries numpy and scipy to find possible zeroes of a polynomia
#the only catch, you guess the zero first

#Ensure you install the library in a virtual env
#pip install numpy
#pip install scipy
Then the code allows the user to enter polynomials from the highest coefficient.
#hopefully i will improve the programe to generate graph of the polynomial
